A Pure component performs more efficiently compared to a Simple component when both are implementing the same functionality. The key difference lies in the rendering behavior. The Pure component only renders when the state, particularly the toggle button state, changes. In contrast, the Simple component renders the entire component even when the state remains constant. This can be observed in the console by clicking the counter button. In the Simple component, the message 'This is Simple Component' is displayed every time the counter button is clicked, irrespective of the constant state. However, in the Pure component, the message 'This is Pure Component' is not displayed under the same scenario.
